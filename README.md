Tool for adding custom search engines to browser. It can be also used to make aliases for address bar without any browser extension.

### Example

```
add-search-engine "Facebook Conversations" https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/{searchTerms}
```

The page for adding search engine will be opened in your default browser. Add the search engine (corresponding button will appear in search bar) and set keyword (for example, `fb`) for it.

Now you can open conversation with a person typing the following in address bar:

```
fb <nickname>
```
